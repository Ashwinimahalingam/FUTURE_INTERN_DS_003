# FUTURE_INTERN_DS_003
Analyzed student feedback data using NLP techniques to identify satisfaction levels and key improvement areas. Applied preprocessing, visualization, and sentiment analysis to uncover insights."
ðŸš€ Thrilled to share my latest project on Student Feedback Analysis! ðŸ“Š

In this project, I explored how data can reveal meaningful insights about student experiences.
Hereâ€™s what I worked on:
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization & Analysis â€“ using Python libraries in Jupyter Notebook to create clear, insightful charts.
ðŸ”¹ Key Findings â€“ identifying strengths such as [faculty support / teaching quality] and areas for improvement like [infrastructure / learning resources].

This project was a great learning experience that allowed me to:
âœ¨ Strengthen my skills in Python, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis
âœ¨ Understand how feedback data can drive strategic improvements in education
âœ¨ Gain confidence in working with real-world datasets

Iâ€™m excited to keep building more projects that combine data analysis and problem-solving. ðŸŒŸ
